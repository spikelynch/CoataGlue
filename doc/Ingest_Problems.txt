TODO for metadata ingest

- Decide which field we are using to control publication and
  make sure that it's being set 

- Ensure that as many of the required fields as possible are being
  crosswalked


- LOOK UP the person record in Mint and use that to populate the metadata
  record with name etc

- Same thing for projects















Getting ReDBox ingest andd curation to work how I think it should...

- all of the metadata record is being passed through, but the
  connections to Mint records for the researcher are not.


Possible points of failure:

* my local ReDBox communicating with the Mint.



Reading through:

http://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/documentation/system-overview/curating-linked-data/curation-configuration

dc:relation.vivo:Dataset.0.dc:identifier <- with 0, refers to the 'base field'. With 1, the first, with 2, the second.

Relationship keys should always be base fields.

Need to keep instances (1, 2, etc) distinct.

Try this tomorrow: explicitly spell out all the fields to be copied from the Mint record in the harvest JSON?

Fallback: have CoataGlue look up the user ID in the staff module (or a
copy of it) and populate the XML metadata with surname, name, etc.

Ingested Relationships

Am working through the Mint docs but should apply to RB - maybe.

in global config:
transformerDefaults { ingest-relations: { id: ingest-relations } }

- this will only work in Mint, I think, because it assumes that the
  other records are at the same level - what we need is a lookup into
  the Mint from Redbox.

- the Mint server is choking, so I'm putting this aside until Paul fixes it:
  going to work on the import - to - Fedora side.
