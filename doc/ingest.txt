Steps to take place for metadata ingest.

* Check to see if this dataset has already been ingested - if it has, ignore it
  (we aren't updating existing datasets)

* Check to see if the project exists in Mint.

* If not -> write an activity record into Mint ingest

* Check to see if the experiment creator exists in the mint

* If not - ?

* Write the HTML human/machine-readable document based on the template

* Add the HTML as a datastream to the Fedora object

* Write the Fedora ID into the XML

* Build the description field according to the description template

* Write the dataset XML for RedBox (this includes the templated description)

* Add the dataset to Fedora
