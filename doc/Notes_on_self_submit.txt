Self-submission as data capture
-------------------------------

Researcher self-submit can work like data capture, with the order of ID
assignment the other way around.

Data capture works like this:

     Metadata and payload appears in a data source.

     Metadata is crosswalked to standard format

     A fedora object is created

     Datastreams are copied to the web server's filesystem and added to the
     Fedora object

     A standard XML file is written to ReDBox - this contains the dataset's
     Damyata (landing page) URL, which contains the Fedora ID

     ...ReDBox harvests it

     Damyata serves up the landing page, checking ReDBox for publication
     status (by looking up the Damyata URL)

In the case of self-submit, the redbox record is created first.  It could
work like this:

     Researcher adds a record to ReDBox

     Either right away, or later, they follow a link to the data upload app,
     which contains the collection's ReDBox oid.

     The upload app shows them the metadata from ReDBox (via solr lookup)
     and allows them to upload file(s).

     After upload, the app creates a fedora object and adds the payload 
     as datastream(s).

     The data now has a Damyata URL: write this back to the ReDBox record
     as a linked URL

     From this point onward the process is the same....
