Notes on how metadata conversion works.

A two-stage process.

The CoataGlue::Converter class takes a dataset (in whatever file format
or folder combination) and returns a raw metadata hashref.

The CoataGlue::Source then uses its templates to crosswalk the raw
metadata (which will have weird headers, source-specific technical
fields, etc) into a standard metadata hash.

The standard metadata is what will get written into ReDBox and Fedora.

The two processes (conversion and crosswalk) are separated out because
hopefully we'll one day have lots of different DC sources using the
same conversion class, but with different templates to generate
a description from the technical metadata.
