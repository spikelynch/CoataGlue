CoataGlue
=========

CoataGlue is a set of utilities for crosswalking, formatting, storing
and publishing research data and metadata.  It serves as a common
backend for the three data capture subprojects developed at the
University of Technology, Sydney.

This code was developed with funding from ANDS - the Australian
National Data Service - as part of projects DC18 Data Capture and MS22
Metadata Stores
