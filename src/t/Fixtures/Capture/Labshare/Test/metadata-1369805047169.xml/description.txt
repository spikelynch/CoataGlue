This dataset describes the baseline characteristics of a small wavetank used to test the efficiency of scale models  wave power devices such   as Oscillating Water Columns. The rig consists of a 4.9 metre wave tank with a paddle wheel at one end which generates propagating waves. The   tank features a beach that is overtopped by the waves to prevent wave refection. This means there is a constant source of waves. The water   that overtops the beach is pumped back into the tank to maintain the water level.
