The rig consists of a 4.9 metre wave tank with a paddle wheel at one end which generates propagating waves. The   tank features a beach that is overtopped by the waves to prevent wave refection. This means there is a constant source of waves. The water   that overtops the beach is pumped back into the tank to maintain the water level. </description><title>UTS FEIT Wavetank Characterisation dataset</title><supervisor>890530</supervisor><FOR>090608</FOR><share>Y</share><access>open access</access><location>file:///home/mike/workspace/RDC Data Capture/src/t/Test/Capture/Labshare/Data/wavetank-1369807339.csv</location><location>file:///home/mike/workspace/RDC Data Capture/src/t/Test/Capture/Labshare/Data/wavetank-1369806291.csv</location></rdcingest>
